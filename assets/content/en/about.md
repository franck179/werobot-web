## Our history

Our non-profit was founded in May 2017. Its first goal was our participation in the [First Global Challenge 2017](https://first.global/archive/fgc-2017/) in Washington D.C.

### First contest

After three months spent building, training and communicating, we finally met the 156 attending countries. Unfortunately, bad alliances and poor robot efficiency led us to a disappointing ranking. Nevertheless, our well documented blog made us come back with the silver medal of the Sofia Kovalevskaya award.

### 2017-2018 season

We participated in two competitions :
- The [trophées de robotique](http://tropheesderobotique.fr)
  - First the regional contest. We ranked second and thus were qualified for the national level.
  - Then the national contest, during two days in Saint-Quentin. We ended 20th out of 62 teams.
- The 18th World Adolescent Robot Contest in the FGC category.

This contest took place in Guyiang, China. Thirty teams were attending : 15 chinese teams and 15 international ones.

We won two awards:
  - The international unity award for the help we provided to other teams and our involvement in communication.
  - The winning alliance award because we won this championship.

### 2018-2019 season

Our non-profit evolves. We have new team members to participate in contest and, moreover, we begin an education component by animating a weekly robotic worshop for children in the [social center Condorcet](https://www.espacecondorcet.org/).

This season, we plan to participate in the [trophées de robotique](http://tropheesderobotique.fr) once again and [Astro-Pi](https://www.astro-pi.org).
